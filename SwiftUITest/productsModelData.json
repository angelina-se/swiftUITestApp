Harry's room is a tiny Cupboard Under the Stairs, he hasn't had a birthday party in ten years,and his birthday present is his uncle's old socks. But all that is about to change when a mysterious letter arrives by owl messenger.",

For in Harry's second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and horrors arise, including an outrageously stuck-up new professor and a spirit who haunts the girl's bathroom. But then the real trouble begins - something is attacking Hogwarts students, making them rigid like statues. Could it be Draco Malfoy, a more poisonous rival than ever? Could it possibly be Hagrid, whose mysterious past reveals dark  secrets? Or could it be the one everyone at Hogwarts most suspects ... Harry Potter himself!",

It's assumed that Hogwarts is the safest place for Harry to be.
